SQL-scripts to build necessary tables rights and wassanots. Assumes that you have a postgresql database - a fairly recent edition - with earthcoord enabled. Assumes that you have a user named "pehmo" who owns the database called "pehmobase". If you need instructions how to provide this, then this project is not probably yet for you anyway. This is work in progress.

I also assume that you have mosBase and so does the scripts. Namely the require "pohja" ja "log"-tables from it.
